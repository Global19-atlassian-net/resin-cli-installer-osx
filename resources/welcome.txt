Welcome to the installation of the Resin CLI tool, an advanced way to communicate with Resin.io

This installer automates the process of installing NodeJS and fetching the Resin CLI from NPM.

Notice that the installer will not install NodeJS if you have it already installed in your system, and accesible from the PATH.
